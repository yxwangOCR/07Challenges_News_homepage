# Frontend Mentor - News homepage

## The challenge

This challenge is to build out this news website homepage and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

We can use any tools we like to help us complete the challenge. 

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page


Here we can find both a mobile and a desktop version of the design:
